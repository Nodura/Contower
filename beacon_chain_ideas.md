## Brainstorm-Ideas

1. **Way for lighthouse to update bootstrapped nodes**
2. **Finding out how the beacon nodes exchange data (blocks)**
3. **Figure out how the whole of lighthouse is working**
4. **Create the mechanism that will get the peers from the peers that we or they are connected to (kind of like PEX exchanging)**
5. **Implement a mechanism that will store the found peers in a dataset (like a hashmap), and maybe add a listener for when a peer makes a new block or we have to send requests to the peers for the current block number**
6. **Check if different consensus clients are able to exchange data (e.g. blocks)**
