# My plan for the project

- ### Ok so i have an idea of making a sort of beacon node that will act as a relay or a proxy you could say. The main goals of this is to make sure that this "beacon node" is participating in the ethereum 2.0 network and that it will find all peers within the network, now that might sound hard to do but i think its possible. With that comes making connections to peers that we discover over time, however 1 beacon node can probably not handle millions of connections at once. So thats why i thought of this relay that where it would receive alot of request of other peers and then sort of "reflect" them to other peers, to make sure we dont overload our REAL beacon node (lighthouse). So it would look somewhat like this: Random_peer1 -> My_node -> Random_peer2, and then "Random_peer2" send it back the data (response) to "My_node" and we send it back to "Random_peer1". So like this Random_peer2 -> "My_node" -> Random_peer1.

# ChatGPT suggestions:

- ### Load Balancing

  Since your custom beacon node acts as an intermediary, it would be beneficial to implement some sort of load balancing. This can help distribute requests across multiple real beacon nodes (if you have more than one) or even among other peers, which can enhance your system's capability to handle more requests.

- ### Cache Mechanism

  You can implement a caching layer that stores frequently accessed data or frequently made requests. This can save a round trip to the real beacon node, reducing latency and load.

- ### Rate Limiting and Throttling

  Introduce rate limiting to ensure that no single peer can overwhelm your node. This can be done based on the IP address or some other identifier.

- ### Peer Prioritization

  Using Ethereum 2.0's peer scoring system, you can prioritize which peers to forward requests to. For example, peers with higher scores could be given priority in terms of resource allocation, ensuring that you maintain a good network score.

- ### Compression Algorithms

  To save bandwidth and speed up data transfer, consider implementing data compression algorithms suitable for Ethereum 2.0 network data.

- ### Health Checks

  Implement periodic health checks to the real beacon nodes your custom node is connected to. This ensures that you're always connected to a reliable node.

- ### Monitoring and Logging

  Incorporate comprehensive monitoring and logging features to debug issues and optimize performance. Include metrics that are crucial for the Ethereum 2.0 network, such as peer count, latency, and request success rate.

- ### Connection Pooling

  Maintain a pool of active connections to various peers and real beacon nodes, so you don't have to establish a new connection each time a request comes in.

- ### Failover Strategy

  Implement a failover mechanism to switch to a backup real beacon node in case the primary node fails for some reason.

- ### Real-time Analytics (Optional)

  A dashboard that provides real-time analytics can be very useful for monitoring the health of your custom beacon node and the Ethereum 2.0 network status as a whole.

- ### Request Buffer

  Maintain a request buffer or queue to handle bursty incoming traffic, which can be particularly useful during high-activity periods on the Ethereum 2.0 network.

- ### Documentation and User Guides
  Since you're already planning to document your implementation thoroughly, it might also be helpful to create user guides and API documentation for others who might want to use or contribute to your project.

Combining these features could result in a robust, scalable, and highly efficient custom beacon node that could not only handle a large number of requests but also do so in a way that's beneficial for the Ethereum 2.0 network as a whole.
