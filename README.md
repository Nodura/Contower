# Contower: A Rust-built Proxy for Ethereum 2.0

## Overview

Contower is our fresh take on a Rust-built proxy that's all about upping the game for decentralization on the Ethereum 2.0 network. It's different because it doesn't need its own database. Instead, it's like a middleman that not only makes sure nodes are talking to each other smoothly but also keeps tabs on the latest block data and the state of the blockchain, using something called transient caching. This keeps things efficient and up-to-date.

## Objectives

- **Boosting Network Decentralization:** We're spreading out the workload to make the network more even and strong.
- **Bringing Nodes Together:** Making sure every node is connected and nobody's left out.
- **Using Resources Smartly:** By using transient caching, we keep important data handy without needing to store it forever.

## Functionality

- **Quick to Get Going:** Starts up fast and doesn't hog resources or need a ton of space.
- **Relay Networking:** Handles how nodes connect and talk to each other, using a smart relay setup.
- **Clever Caching:** Quick access to data, especially keeping up with the latest on the blockchain, while staying light on its feet.

## Relay Protocol

Contower smartly sends requests where they need to go and deals with temporary data, making sure the network doesn't get too crowded and stays strong and spread out.
