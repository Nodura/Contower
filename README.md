## Overview

Contower is our fresh take on a Rust-built proxy that's all about upping the game for decentralization on the Ethereum 2.0 network. It's different because it doesn't need its own database. Instead, it's like a middleman that not only makes sure nodes are talking to each other smoothly but also keeps tabs on the latest block data and the state of the blockchain, using something called transient caching. This keeps things efficient and up-to-date.

## Objectives

- **Boosting Network Decentralization:** We're spreading out the workload to make the network more even and strong.
- **Connecting (all) Nodes:** Trying to make sure we can connect to almost the whole network if not all of it.
- **Using Resources Smartly:** By using transient caching, we keep important data handy without needing to store it forever.

## Documentation

We're working on putting together all the guides, API details, and how you can help out.

Hang tight!
