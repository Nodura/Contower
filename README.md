<h1 style="border-bottom:none;">Rome Wasn't Built in a Day,</h1>
<h2 style="border-bottom:none;">Nor in a Week, Where Foundations Lay,</h2>

### Nor in a Month, Where Pillars Rise,

#### Nor in a Year, Where Walls Touch Skies,

##### Nor in a Decade, Where Legends Grow,

###### Nor in a Century, Where Time Does Slow,

# It's Built When Perfection Finds Its Way.
