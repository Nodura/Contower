# Contower: Advancing Decentralization in Ethereum 2.0

## Overview

Contower is an innovative Rust-based proxy designed to enhance decentralization within the Ethereum 2.0 network. Functioning without an internal database, Contower uniquely serves as a relay, facilitating communication and utilizing transient caching for data efficiency.

## Objectives

- **Network Decentralization:** Encourage a more distributed network by spreading the load evenly.
- **Peer Integration:** Connect comprehensively, leaving no node behind.
- **Resource Efficiency:** Utilize transient caching for data, operating without persistent storage.

## Functionality

- **Rapid Initialization:** Begins with a low resource footprint, forgoing the need for hefty storage.
- **Relay Networking:** Manages peer connections and data transfer via a relay mechanism.
- **Smart Caching:** Implements efficient caching for quick data access while upholding a lean operation.

## Relay Protocol

Contower directs any requests smartly and handles transient data, balancing the network load and promoting a robust decentralized environment.

### Flow Diagram

- **Request**: Random_peer1 --> My_node (Relay/Proxy) --> Random_peer2
- **Response**: Random_peer2 --> My_node (Relay/Proxy) --> Random_peer1

## Key Features

- **Load Balancing:** Manages resource distribution for enhanced request handling.
- **Caching:** Reduces latency and unburdens beacon nodes through temporary data storage.
- **Rate Limiting:** Ensures equitable resource use and prevents bottlenecks.
- **Peer Prioritization:** Leverages peer scoring to optimize request routing.
- **Data Compression:** Conserves bandwidth for efficient network performance.
- **Health Monitoring:** Continually assesses node reliability to ensure consistent uptime.
- **Diagnostic Logging:** Tracks performance metrics and facilitates troubleshooting.
- **Connection Pooling:** Maintains a ready roster of node connections for streamlined communication.
- **Failover Mechanisms:** Seamlessly transitions to backup nodes if primary nodes encounter issues.
- **Real-time Analytics:** (Optional) Provides a dashboard for network and node health assessment.
- **Request Queuing:** Manages traffic spikes with an efficient request buffer system.
- **Extensive Documentation:** Offers thorough guides for usage and contribution.
