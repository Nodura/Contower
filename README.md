## Overview

Contower represents a groundbreaking advancement in the Ethereum 2.0 network, uniquely merging the execution and consensus clients into a unified relay/proxy networking client. Crafted with Rust, Contower stands out by eliminating the need for its own database. Functioning as a versatile intermediary, it not only facilitates seamless node communication but also innovatively monitors the latest blockchain developments and state changes through transient caching. This strategic integration not only streamlines network functionality but also enhances overall efficiency and decentralization. By consolidating these key components, Contower sets a new standard in blockchain networking, aiming for full network connectivity and intelligent resource utilization.

## Objectives

- **Enhanced Network Integration:** Seamlessly merging execution and consensus mechanisms to fortify network coherence and resilience.
- **Universal Node Connectivity:** Striving for comprehensive network coverage, connecting a broad spectrum of nodes.
- **Optimized Resource Utilization:** Employing transient caching to maintain critical data accessibly and efficiently.
