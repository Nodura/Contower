## New type of sandwhich ops

- **New type of sandwhich ops**: Basically what this "New type" will be or do is that it takes advantage of normal usual sandwhiches chains them together e.g. It would do normal sandwhiching ***buy/buy/sell*** and then after when it detects a sell order from someone it would sell again so it would do this: ***sell/sell/buy***. So in the end it will look something like this: ***buy/buy/sell/sell/sell/buy***.
