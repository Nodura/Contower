# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

For the latest and supported versions, please see our [Releases](link-to-releases-page). We recommend using the most recently released version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, we ask you to report it through a secure communication channel. Please refrain from creating public tickets mentioning the vulnerability, as this could increase the risk of the vulnerability being exploited before a solution is developed, released, and installed.
